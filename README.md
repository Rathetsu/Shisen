# Shisen

Shisen is a dynamic, visually engaging implementation of the traditional Shisen-Sho tile-matching game, written entirely in Java for an accessible, platform-agnostic gaming experience.

## Installation

To run Shisen, you'll need [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) installed on your machine. 

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rathetsu/Shisen.git
```

2. Navigate into the cloned directory and run the game:

```bash
cd Shisen

## Gameplay

The game board is filled with tiles in an arbitrary layout, but each play must connect matching tiles with a line that has no more than three segments (two turns) and does not cross any other tile.
